        <div class="bloco">
            <div class="listas">
                <ul class="lista">
                    <li>1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>2 cups sugar</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup milk</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol class="lista">
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and grease a round cake pan.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                    <li>In another bowl, beat together the sugar, eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and stir until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Carefully mix in the boiling water — the batter will be thin, but that’s normal.</li>
                    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
                    <li>Let the cake cool for about 10 minutes before removing it from the pan.</li>
                    <li>Allow to cool completely before serving or frosting. Enjoy your rich and moist chocolate cake!</li>
